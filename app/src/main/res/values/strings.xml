        Adding zero to a number has no effect on its identity:<br/>\n<b>➜ n + 0 = n</b><br/>\nin multiplication, any number multiplied by zero is also zero:<br/>\n<b>➜ n x 0 = 0</b><br/>\n0 is a void!<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiplying by one (The identity property):<br/>\nIn short, the identity property states that the product of a given number and one is that number itself:<br/>\n<b>➜ n x 1 = n</b><br/>\n<br/>\nMultiplying a number by one results in the same value. Let\'s say, one x 10 apples results to 10 apples. 1 is a mirror!

For example, multiplying 8 x 2 will give you the same answer as multiplying 2 x 8.
